# E-Commerce site

An E-commerce site that aims to bridge the gap between producers/manufacturers and the consumers. It enables the producers/manufacturers to directly interact and sell to consumers without the need of middlemen/retailers.

This contains the backend for the site which was achieved using django rest framework and reactjs (which is used for the frontend).
